# Project Milestone 2 AR

For the AR portion of Milestone 2, our goal is to create an AR experience that explores the mechanic of a player capturing/finding individual fish. We will be using Vuforia as the software to implement tracked images as well as webcams. The aspect of AR we are exploring is collisions and distances between a controller and an object.

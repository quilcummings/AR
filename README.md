# Project Milestone 2 AR

For the AR portion of Milestone 2, our goal is to create an AR experience that explores the mechanic of a player capturing/finding individual fish. We will be using Vuforia as the software to implement tracked images as well as webcams. The aspect of AR we are exploring is collisions and distances between a controller and an object.

Challenge Focus: The biggest challenge we faced was providing a 100% success rate of the image targets working with the changing backgrounds in the real world environment. We decided to use black text with a white background for the image targets so that the contrast was as high as possible. We chose to use the name of each fish as the image tracker because each word has a unique overall shape as well as numerus feature points and therefore it could be more easily tracked than an alternative. Real world environments are full of patterns and colors and so that is why we ultimately made our image targets using black and white only to address this common AR challenge.
